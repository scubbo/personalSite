&amp;nbsp;Wait, no, hang on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I want to talk to you about some maths. &amp;nbsp;Specifically, a branch called Graph Theory, which was the module that kept me sanest during my final year at Uni, primarily because it involved a lot of drawing pretty pictures (a fact which all my geographer friends were quick to take advantage of!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Graph Theory, a graph isn't something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.analyzemath.com/Graphing/exponential2.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="198" src="http://www.analyzemath.com/Graphing/exponential2.gif" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it's more like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emat6680/yamaguchi/emat6690/essay1/Hamiltonex2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="293" src="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emat6680/yamaguchi/emat6690/essay1/Hamiltonex2.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A "graph" in graph theory terms is a collection of points (or "vertices") joined by lines (or "edges"). &amp;nbsp;Graph theorists study various properties of graphs - the minimum number of edges that must be crossed to get between two vertices, the average number of edges meeting at vertices, and so on. &amp;nbsp;Since these graphs can provide very good models for road layouts and computer networks, you can see how the ability to concisely gather information about them could be useful - but, mostly, we just do it 'cos they're pretty (both mathematically and visually!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to talk about something called a Ramsey number, and outline a simple but elegant proof. &amp;nbsp;This is something where you can follow along at home, kids! &amp;nbsp;Grab a pen and paper and meet me back here! &amp;nbsp;Actually, better make that at least two pens (of different colours), though three would be even more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got 'em? &amp;nbsp;Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, first of all, draw yourself a hexagon - that's a six-sided regular shape, that looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Regular_hexagon.svg/400px-Regular_hexagon.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Regular_hexagon.svg/400px-Regular_hexagon.svg.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;(Do your best to make the corners sharply defined, rather than curves - it'll make your life easier later on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations, you've drawn your first graph! &amp;nbsp;Technically, this called C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, (the C stands for "cyclic", since, as you can see, it resembles a circle in that you can go round in turn and return to your starting place) and there are various things that we could learn from examining it, but I have more a more interesting result in my sights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now join each vertex to every other vertex with a straight line. &amp;nbsp;This should end up looking like this (where the vertices have been highlighted in blue):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Complete_graph_K6.svg/2088px-Complete_graph_K6.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="313" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Complete_graph_K6.svg/2088px-Complete_graph_K6.svg.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you have drawn is called the "&lt;i&gt;complete graph on 6 vertices&lt;/i&gt;", or K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; for short. &amp;nbsp;For any number n, K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is simply n vertices with each one joined to every other. K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is just a single vertex, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a line joining two vertices, K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a triangle, K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a square with the diagonals filled in, and so on, as shown below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.transtutors.com/Uploadfile/CMS_Images/24108_Complete%20Graphs.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="183" src="http://www.transtutors.com/Uploadfile/CMS_Images/24108_Complete%20Graphs.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now, to introduce the Ramsey numbers, I first have to introduce the notion of graph colouring. &amp;nbsp;This is just as it sounds - a colouration of a graph is a drawing of it where all of the edges have a particular colour. &amp;nbsp;So, for instance, this is a colouring in red, blue, and green, on an (incomplete) graph of 20 vertices;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Desargues_graph_3color_edge.svg/250px-Desargues_graph_3color_edge.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Desargues_graph_3color_edge.svg/250px-Desargues_graph_3color_edge.svg.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and this is a colouring in 7 colours (we would say a "7-colouring") of K&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Complete-edge-coloring.svg/220px-Complete-edge-coloring.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Complete-edge-coloring.svg/220px-Complete-edge-coloring.svg.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Note that it doesn't matter that the vertices of this graph aren't arranged around the points of an octagon - graph theory only cares about the connectedness (or unconnectedness) of points, not their relative positions. &amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is still K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; whether it's represented as a small scalene triangle, or an equilateral triangle the size of the galaxy)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now (and don't worry, I'll come back and explain this later), we define the Ramsey number R(m) as being the smallest number n such that, for any 2-colouring of K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, there will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;be a monochromatic K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phew...what on earth does that mean! &amp;nbsp;Well, let's start off with a simple example. &amp;nbsp;Let's try to find R(2) - that is, the smallest number n such that, if we link up all n vertices with either red or blue lines, we'll either have a red K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or we'll have a blue K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Well, since&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;is just a single edge, if there's more than one vertex in our graph, there's bound to be either a red or a blue&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, otherwise we haven't coloured it all - but if there's only one vertex in our graph, there are no edges (nothing to link to!), so no&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&amp;nbsp; So R(2) is 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get a bit more adventurous. &amp;nbsp;What's R(3)? &amp;nbsp;Well, it's clearly bigger than 3 - as long as you don't use the same colour to draw all three sides of the triangle, you won't end up with a monochromatic triangle in your colouration. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, we can 2-colour&amp;nbsp;K&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;(remember, a square with the diagonals drawn in) without making a mono-K&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;- for instance, draw the outside square in red and the diagonals in blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post is dragging on a little, so I'll set you a question to ponder and give the answer (and proof) in the next post - what is R(3)? &amp;nbsp;If you think you know it, try to consider how you'd prove it - how can you prove, for instance, that there isn't a satisfactory 2-colouring on a smaller complete graph? &amp;nbsp;I'll warn you now, while sketching out some ideas will help, trying to prove a result by exhausting all possible colourations will take you a while - there are, for instance, 378 possible colourations of&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;super&gt;*&lt;/super&gt;, so you'll be there for a while! &amp;nbsp;I'll give the solution and proof next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* - where xCy is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient" target="_blank"&gt;choose function&lt;/a&gt;, there are 8C2 = 28 edges (for each of the eight vertices, there is precisely one edge for every way of choosing two of them), and so, since there is one colouration for every way of choosing a colour for each of these, there are 28C2 = 378 colourations. &amp;nbsp;For mathematicians - yes, I'm aware that I've double-counted isomorphic colourations, but if you're seeking a solution by brute force exhaustion like this, it's appropriate to warn of an appropriate upper bound!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I tried to get a definitive answer on the number of 2-colourings of&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;by using Wolfram Alpha, a "computational knowledge engine". &amp;nbsp;The results were...less than satisfactory:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/wVL1d.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="231" src="http://i.imgur.com/wVL1d.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7950918727889811378-2303138890629732134?l=nftnf.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://nftnf.blogspot.com/2012/04/maths-is-just-colouring-in-really.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Scubbo)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7950918727889811378.post-4725372242565174341</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2012 21:35:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-04-24T22:35:41.248+01:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Books</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Game Of Thrones</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Fantasy</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Adaptations</category><title>And after the drought...</title><description>Ooooh, Blogger has had an overhaul! &amp;nbsp;Long overdue, the old interface really didn't fit in with the sleek shiny unified Google UI look they've been moving towards. &amp;nbsp;A little confusing for now, but I'm sure I'll get used to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;Insert tired excuse for not posting here&amp;gt; - yeah, I really have no excuse. &amp;nbsp;And this is going to be a bit short and sweet anyway. &amp;nbsp;Apologies for those hanging on my every word!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not surprise you to hear that I've been watching, and very much enjoying, the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004LRO176/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004LRO176"&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt; TV series (adapted from the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004GJXQ20/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004GJXQ20"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; by George R. R. Martin). &amp;nbsp;In Season Two (slightly confusingly, still titled Game Of Thrones, despite being adapted from the second book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007447833/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0007447833"&gt;A Clash of Kings&lt;/a&gt;), an increasing number of liberties have been taken with the canon, which is enraging some of the more die-hard fans. &amp;nbsp;Characters have been introduced or written out, conversations happen in different ways, at different times, and sometimes between different characters. &amp;nbsp;More commonly, the tone and subtext of exchanges is altered, both by the lack of internal monologue, and the choice of which lines to keep and which to cut/merge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think they're doing a fantastic job. &amp;nbsp;I'm very much of the opinion that to stay slavishly true to the original is the mark of a lazy adapter. &amp;nbsp;If you're reinterpreting a work, you are creating a new piece of art, which, by the nature of its different medium, must fulfil different demands and work in a different way. &amp;nbsp;The truly excellent comic book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1852860243/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1852860243"&gt;Watchmen&lt;/a&gt;, by Alan Moore (which you really should read, by the way - it is one of the best arguments for comics being "not just for kids anymore", along with the truly staggering &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1848565631/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1848565631"&gt;Sandman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;series by Neil Gaiman) was adapted into an equally excellent &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00280LN5Q/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00280LN5Q"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;, which managed to please critics despite having a completely different ending! &amp;nbsp;The different interpretation of results, however, was not only well supported by the preceding drama, but also lent itself well to the silver screen, and so, it was a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most obviously different conditions between books and TV are both caused by timing. &amp;nbsp;When reading a book, you can take your time over it, re-read sentences, and work your way to the subtext and the implications - two things that Martin loves to spread throughout his writing. &amp;nbsp;A TV viewer doesn't have that luxury, and so insinuations and hints have to be made a little more explicit. &amp;nbsp;Conversations must necessarily lose a little of their subtlety, or risk leaving non-readers stranded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, a TV episode has to keep viewers wanting more, and so each episode must end on a cliffhanger, a dramatic scene, or at the very least something that makes viewers think that they will want to tune in again next week. &amp;nbsp;While books can employ similar techniques (and, indeed, several of Martin's chapters do end on notes that leave readers frantically scrabbling through pages to find the resolution), they are not forced to with the same regularity as episodes, and do not have to hit the same narrative "beats". &amp;nbsp;Chopping and changing of event orders is entirely understandable, under this pressure. &amp;nbsp;As a good example, a particular character would have, in the books, spent several weeks wandering the wilderness, hiding from marauders and would-be captors, in the narrative space between episodes 3 and 4, before finally being captures. In the show, she is taken directly from her previous escort. &amp;nbsp;While the intervening time helps build the sense of desperation, it is not, narratively, important, and so its removal is justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are downsides, of course. &amp;nbsp;I fear that viewers are missing out on some of the rich backstory and history of the world, and that future plot twists might seem a little like &lt;i&gt;Di ex machina&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;without the subtle foreshadowing that peppered the books - but, on the whole, I feel that a hard job is being done very well, and the crew and cast should feel very proud! &amp;nbsp;Of course, it does help to have the author as an Executive Co-producer :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, at the end of the day, this way someone who has only seen the show can effectively discover a whole new depth to the series by reading the books, furthering their enjoyment - and that can't be bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[A personal plea - those links what you see up there are Amazon Affiliate links. If you click them and then buy anything (not necessarily the product they link to, as long as you browse in the same tab), a percentage of what you spend will go to me instead of Amazon, at no extra cost to you. &amp;nbsp;Obviously, if you're thinking of expanding your library, or indeed buying anything Amazon-wise, I'd very much appreciate it if you did so via these links! &amp;nbsp;It's completely anonymous and, once again, adds not a cent to the price you pay]&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7950918727889811378-4725372242565174341?l=nftnf.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://nftnf.blogspot.com/2012/04/and-after-drought.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Scubbo)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7950918727889811378.post-6983433052721815257</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2012 19:12:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-04-10T20:12:28.118+01:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Mass Effect</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>I am not very good at video games</category><title>Meditations on Mass Effect 2</title><description>A quick and unpolished blog post because, well, I wrote most of this out on Facebook, and then I remembered that I hadn't posted anything here in a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, thoughts on Mass Effect 2;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's better.  A lot better.  A LOT better.  Almost every aspect has improved - the storyline, characterisation and voice acting, and level design, in particular, show a MARKED improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that feels worse, however, (and I seem to be in the minority in feeling this) is the combat.  Finding cover is hit-and-miss, with Shepherd regularly diving into cover and then standing straight back up again, or outright refusing to duck behind/out of an area that is obviously intended as such.  Add to that the fact that a number of enemy weapons appear to ignore cover, to the point of even knocking you OUT of cover, and it rapidly becomes frustrating.  When you can find a safe place to fire from, the scatter radius is so large that I'm essentially spraying bullets in the approximate direction of the enemy (admittedly, this may be due to the fact that Vanguard appears to have been nerfed between games, but the rest still stands - though, on that topic, where'd all my skill customisation options go!? &amp;nbsp;And Lift!? &amp;nbsp;Lift was AWESOME! &amp;nbsp;Don't give me this "Charge" bullshit, that's crap and you know it.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's all the more frustrating since the combat difficulty has ramped up MASSIVELY between games.  I think I died maybe ten times, if that, in the whole of Mass Effect, so I thought I'd try this game on Veteran.  Even after I gave up and switched back to Normal after trying the same mission twenty times, I'm still dying two or three times on each non-mook fight.  I'm switching weapons to prioritise barrier/amour/health etc., and making extensive use of biotics, but the deciding factor in most fights seems to be the suicidally depressed (or otherwise) impulses of the AI.  If they break cover to flank me, I haven't got a hope (whereas if I try to do the same, I'm gunned down inside two seconds), but if they stay put I can whittle their health down inch by inch. &amp;nbsp;Maybe I haven't got the hang of the combat system, but I'm definitely finding the regular restarting is interrupting my enjoyment of an otherwise excellent story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the story *is* excellent, and I'm sure once I've had the chance to do a few side missions (which seem a lot thinner on the ground this time round) Shepherd will be more effective than a disable Chihuahua trying to hump the Collectors' collective legs and I'll enjoy combat a bit more. &amp;nbsp;I just hope it comes around sooner!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7950918727889811378-6983433052721815257?l=nftnf.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://nftnf.blogspot.com/2012/04/meditations-on-mass-effect-2.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Scubbo)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7950918727889811378.post-8825214429838447945</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 20:19:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-03-12T20:35:06.036Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>innuendo</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>word puzzles</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>coding</category><title>A quick and dirty bit of fun</title><description>Coding fun, that is. &amp;nbsp;Why, what were you thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/amy_b_h"&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt;, for reasons best known to herself, posited the following problem on Facebook:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Challenge: See how many words you can make using the letters from "entertainment", but *only* in the order they originally appear, i.e. tram is fine but meat is not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll ignore the pro-public-transport-and-vegetarianism agenda clearly supported by this brain-washing exercise, and focus on solving the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the word list available here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/enable1.txt"&gt;http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/enable1.txt&lt;/a&gt; to solve the problem. &amp;nbsp;A more efficient, but slightly less comprehensive, solution would have used the Official Scrabble Wordlist, which is limited to words of eight or fewer letters, and is available here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/ospd.txt"&gt;http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/ospd.txt&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Thankfully, "aardwolf", my new favourite word, is included on both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Python script I used to solve the problem can be found here:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://pastebin.com/1QvTwvCq"&gt;http://pastebin.com/1QvTwvCq&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Anyone on a Mac or a UNIX/Linux computer should be able to simply run the script by double-clicking it -

and, as John Jenkins said in a review, "It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had great fun poking around in the many dusty old bookstores of Uppingham, happening across all manner of quaint and curious volumes of forgotten lore which, if I had a thousand lifetimes and funds to match, I would happily devour. &amp;nbsp;Eventually I tracked down battered old paperback versions, which were promptly bought on my behalf and ceremonially presented to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foundation saga is one of Asimov's two best known series, along with the Robots series. &amp;nbsp;The main premise of this futuristic storyline is the concept that, with a great deal of sophistication and study, and the application of statistical modelling, it would be possible to refine large-scale sociology to the state of being a predictive science, capable (in the hands of a skilled analyst) of making accurate forecasts of the behaviour of large bodies of people. &amp;nbsp;Using this newly-founded discipline of "psychohistory", a man named Hari Seldon realises that the current apparently-glorious Galactic Empire is soon headed for a collapse, after which there will be a period of thirty thousand years of "dark ages", where planets will become cut off from one another, and science and civilization will regress. &amp;nbsp;He foresaw a solution to the equations, however, wherein this interregnum was limited to only one thousand years, after which a new uniting Empire would arise, preserving the knowledge and culture of humanity. &amp;nbsp;To this end, he commissions the foundation of a colony of scientists and researchers at the precise point in unsettled space where, according to his calculations, the evolution of their society will be such that they will be perfectly situated to react to any emerging threats, and to spread their influence until they can establish a new Empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book in the series, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0586010807/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0586010807"&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, was originally written and published as a string of short stories, which together told of the Foundation's rise to prominence - and it is simply wonderful. &amp;nbsp;While the writing isn't of Shakespearean, Wildean, or Wodehousean standards, it's still very enjoyable - but the beauty of the series lies not in its language, but in its content. &amp;nbsp;Each episode&amp;nbsp;succinctly&amp;nbsp;encapsulates another stage in the society's development, with most providing some sort of interesting twist or witty observation. &amp;nbsp;The next two books,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0586013555/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0586013555"&gt;Foundation and Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0586017135/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0586017135"&gt;Second Foundation&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;told more of a cohesive story - of the burgeoning Foundation's clashes with the expiring Empire, and subsequently with a mutated human named the Mule, who has the ability to affect emotions and inspire fanatical loyalty - something which Seldon's plan, relying as it did abstractions over large groups of people and the assumption that no single person could have a measurable effect on galactic civilization, was not designed to accommodate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three fantastic books, with which Asimov was well-pleased, and which wrapped up with a satisfying conclusion. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, while the series continued to be popular more than thirty years after their publication, Asimov's publishers exerted increasing pressure on him to return to the series, despite his protests. &amp;nbsp;"Foundation's Edge" is the result - and his lack of inspiration really shows. &amp;nbsp;The writing falls prey to the worst pitfalls of bad science-fiction writing - over-emphasis on technological development itself (rather than its effect on persons and society), and "tell, not show" dialogue - "as I'm sure you're aware, my friend, this ship is equipped with the latest gravitic drive technology...". &amp;nbsp;In fact, there is a character - a previously planet-bound historian who accompanies the main character on his journeys - who, except for one short passage in which he takes a leading role, serves solely as an exposition-post: "oh, I know nothing of the ways of space travel - please, tell me [and the reader] what is going on!". &amp;nbsp;I paraphrase, but the awkwardness of the writing is of almost that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's more, the book isn't redeemed by its predecessors' intriguing insights or unexpected twists either. Every "surprise" is easily foreseeable, every hidden allegiance is plainly obvious - it got to the stage that I was almost expecting a double-bluff, so obvious were the deceptions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wouldn't recommend reading this, unless you are a fanatic Foundation fan and are absolutely desperate for more material (though, even more so than with the latter Matrix movies, it is a "sequel" in almost name-only - the content and style is so far removed to be almost unrecognisable). &amp;nbsp;I'm not even sure that I'll be reading the fifth book, Foundation and Earth. &amp;nbsp;Far better to enjoy the sublime three original books in isolation, and then to move on to another master of science fiction without sullying them. &amp;nbsp;On that note, I discovered that I still have&amp;nbsp;Iain M. Banks' &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1857231384/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=newfrothene0e-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1857231384"&gt;Consider Phlebas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;sitting on my bookshelf - since the last two of his books that I read were outstanding (and worthy of posts in their own right - certainly The Culture should really have been mentioned in any discussion of transhumanism, so I'll have to remember that for my follow-up post!), and I've been reliably informed that this is even better, I have high hopes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may notice that I've been linking out to Amazon more than usual in this post - that's no coincidence. &amp;nbsp;I've just signed up for a service known as "Amazon Associates", whereby, if someone clicks on a link from my site to Amazon and then buys an item, 5% of the price goes to me instead of Amazon (the user pays the same price). &amp;nbsp;I don't foresee being able to retire on the proceeds anytime soon, but I figure every little helps!

The subscript "i" is the index of the sequence. &amp;nbsp;For instance, x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;would be the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;number in the sequence, x&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;the 52&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, and so on. &amp;nbsp;[n] is a shorthand notation for "the set of numbers less than or equal to that number" - so [9] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. &amp;nbsp;The symbol ∀ means "for all" - so this statement is saying "whichever number you choose for i,&amp;nbsp;x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;will be a whole number between 0 and 9 inclusive"&lt;br /&gt;2. This is defining what we mean by "palindromic" in terms of mathematical notation.&lt;br /&gt;3. That symbol ∃ means "there exists" - i.e., we are looking for the probability that there is a number n such that, if we chop off the sequence at the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;number, it will form a palindrome.&lt;br /&gt;4. The double-struck P (this font is sometimes called "Blackboard Bold") stands for "probability". &amp;nbsp;The "U" symbol stands for "Union" (essentially, "combining" various events), and the sub- and super-script means that we are taking the union from j=2 to infinity. &amp;nbsp;That is, we are looking for the probability that any truncation of the sequence (of length two or more) will be a palindrome.&lt;br /&gt;5. This is stating the probability of the truncation at the nth digit being a palindrome. &amp;nbsp;"floor" is a function that gives the smallest whole number less than or equal to the argument - so floor(2.5) is 2, but floor(3) is 3. &amp;nbsp;The explanation for this probability is as follows; in order for a sequence to be a palindrome, we need the second half of the numbers (rounded down) to match the first half. &amp;nbsp;The probability of any one number matching its partner is 1/10 (as there are 10 digits to choose from), so the probability of all of them matching is (1/10)&lt;sup&gt;floor(j/2)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;- and since (1/10) can be represented as 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, this gives the probability given above.&lt;br /&gt;6. Putting a bar over a symbol or expression in maths is a common way of expressing "not/negation". &amp;nbsp;In this case, since A&lt;sub&gt;(n)&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the probability of the n-truncated sequence being a palindrome,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(n)&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the probability of it&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;being a palindrome. &amp;nbsp;If p is the probability of an event happening, then 1-p is the probability of that event not happening.&lt;br /&gt;7. The spikey-E shape on the right-hand side here is called "Sigma". &amp;nbsp;It represents repeated addition - in this case, "add up all values of&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;10&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;-floor(j/2)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;from j=2 upwards". &amp;nbsp;We can do this because the probabilites of A(n) are mutually exclusive - that is, the probability of either one of them occurring is the addition of both of their probabilities. &amp;nbsp;Since floor(2n/2) = floor(2n+1/2), this is equal to twice the addition with the floor and division-by-two removed.&lt;br /&gt;The dot over the 2 means "repeating" - that is, the probability is 0.22222...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, the maths above, in which I can't find a problem, gives us a 0.2222... probability of any given random sequence of numbers having a palindromic. &amp;nbsp;In hindsight, and having benefitted from the added insight afforded by having to explain my working, I'm less uncomfortable with this answer than I was before - an answer of 0 would have been non-sensical, as clearly some random sequences exist with a palindromic truncation, but so would 1 as there "do" exist infinite sequences not containing palindromes. &amp;nbsp;In fact, the construction of palindromes is quite artificial, so you would expect them to be reasonably rare. &amp;nbsp;0.222... therefore seems a sensible value for this probability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's amazing how quickly I've lost my fluency with maths, and especially probability - I could still remember all the pertinent details and get it done, but with none of the fluidity that I used to have! &amp;nbsp;Definitely need to keep my brain in gear somehow...the iTunes U courses that have been recommended might be a good idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hope you've enjoyed this jaunt through maths...I'm at home right now, and our dinner guest has just appeared, so I must away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=7950918727889811378" name="footnote1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;A "normal" number is one in which every possible digit (from 0 to 9, in the decimal system) occurs with the same density (i.e. has the same "chance" of occurring), every pair of digits has an equal density, every triple has an equal density, every string of four digits has an equal density, and so on. &amp;nbsp;Confusingly, the vast majority of numbers that we encounter outside of a maths degree are not normal, because they are either integers ("whole numbers"), or terminating decimals (e.g. 5.324, as opposed to a non-terminating decimal like 7.3333333...). &amp;nbsp;A little thought will show that neither of these can be normal, since they only have a finite number of digits to play with, and so they could not fulfil all of the conditions - trivially, it cannot be true that an integer with n digits contains all (n-1)-length digit strings with equal density, because there is only room for two such strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=7950918727889811378" name="footnote2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indeed, this is certain&amp;nbsp;to happen in an infinite random sequence. &amp;nbsp;Consider the fact that dd is a palindrome for any digit d. &amp;nbsp;Then we seek the probability that the sequence contains any dd. &amp;nbsp;The probability that any digit pair is any dd is 1/10 (the first digit can be chosen freely, and there is a one in ten chance that the next digit matches), so the probability they do not match is thus 9/10. &amp;nbsp;The probability that not a single pair of digits in the sequence match is (9/10)*(9/10)*(9/10)*..., which tends to 0. &amp;nbsp;So the probability that the sequence contains a matching pair (which are a palindrome) is 1.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7950918727889811378-2552157750155999727?l=nftnf.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://nftnf.blogspot.com/2012/03/pilindrome.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Scubbo)</author><thr:total>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7950918727889811378.post-8603355579431351961</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2012 20:28:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-27T20:28:12.154Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>transhumanism</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>I rant</category><title>Transhumanism - what is it, and what will it do to you?</title><description>After the last few Facebook updates, I'm not sure if this is even still visible, but once upon a time, on that hallowed Internet tome, I described my Religious views as "Transhumanist Discordian Buddhist" (you can probably infer what a smug little self-satisfied prick I was at that age by the fact that I simultaneously gave my Political views as "Non-believer".). &amp;nbsp;As has already been pointed out to me, I can't legitimately lay claim to being a devout Buddhist (since I, among other unworthy activities, eat meat), which I readily concede - the union of these three is simply the most efficient way of concisely approximating most of my worldview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I would LOVE to spread the word of Discordianism a bit further, I believe it's one of those things that's far better discovered on your own. &amp;nbsp;For eager disciples of the Way, the holy text can be found here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/5.php"&gt;http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/5.php&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, though, a Discordian is prohibited of[sic] believing what he reads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Note - if you've never heard of the concept of transhumanism before, don't click the link in the following paragraph until I tell you to!]&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I chose to write about Transhumanism this week is because of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/2011/07/16/when-will-we-be-transhuman-seven-conditions-for-attaining-transhumanism/" target="_blank"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which I found very thought-provoking. &amp;nbsp;Although I don't agree whole-heartedly with all the points made in it, it's a very good jumping-off point for debate on the concept as a whole - what is it, what does it entail, is it a worthy goal, and how close are we getting to it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following are entirely my own opinions, based off what I have read on the topic. &amp;nbsp;I intentionally haven't referred to other sources (except the article mentioned above) in writing this, because I wanted this to be a personal account - if I simply copy-and-pasted Wikipedia's definition, I wouldn't really be producing anything new! &amp;nbsp;Therefore, any definite statements on the topic (e.g. "Transhumanism is") should always be regarded as being preceded with "in my opinion".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahem. &amp;nbsp;Transhumanism is a paradigm which holds that it is crucial for sentient beings to grow and develop, and that two vital parts of that growth are the betterment of tools (making the growth exponential), and developing the ability to take control of and modify oneself. &amp;nbsp;To this end, transhumanists embrace the possibility of cybernetic implants, the development of artificial intelligences, and the furtherance of medical science, with the ultimate end goal of transcending the limitations inherent in our bodies as they currently are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[This is probably a good point to go read that article, if you haven't already]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, ok, so at first glance this might seem like a slightly more high-brow justification for nerds who were already wildly enthusiastic about computers and robots - and, I'll admit, this was what first snared my interest with the idea when I was young! &amp;nbsp;But, as with good sci-fi stories (and one day I will write an entire rant about what sci-fi really is, and what it isn't - here's a clue, putting spaceships or lasers into your story doesn't make it sci-fi, and vice versa), the otherness of the initial impression can help to raise interesting questions that are immediately relevant to our own lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found points 5 and 7 in the linked article to be particularly interesting (if the reference to African grey parrots puzzled you, by the way, read &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_(parrot)" target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, though prepare to get a little teary!). &amp;nbsp;They are, if you'll excuse a little pretension in my language (and if you won't, you've certainly come to the wrong place), emergent properties of initial impulse. &amp;nbsp;As human lifespans lengthen, the increasing over-population will make debate over contraception all the more urgent, prompting further discussion on the right to parenthood and early rights. &amp;nbsp;Likewise, when we start constructing/becoming/encountering organisms that transcend our instinctive definitions of "human", the paradigm shift required to recognise the sentience and agency of non-humans should, hopefully, make it that much easier for us to recognise the inherent rights of other non-human creatures with which we are already familiar, and the ludicrousness of the idea that humans should have different rights because of different race, class, or sexual orientation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aaah, I've already ranted for many many and still have lots more to say, but people would be in danger of nodding off. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully this will be a primer good enough to get people intrested in the topic, so that my follow-up post (WHEN it comes, not if!) will be better received. If you're interested in some further musings on how the progress of transhumanism might affect our view on natural rights, and how you might already hold some transhumanism ideals dear without even realising it, browse through &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/2011/05/14/the-hidden-message-in-pixars-films/" target="_blank"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about Pixar films. &amp;nbsp;For a good refutation of one of the main counter-arguments to human improvement ("When everyone is special, no-one is", or "It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."), via two of my favourite books and films, see &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/2011/07/04/enders-game-proves-that-every-child-deserves-to-be-gifted-and-talented/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;And for an article on the development of the ability of storytelling to explore non-anthropocentric narratives, and the philosophical points that then emerge - an article that is only tangentally related to the subject of this post, but whose quality renders it deserving of far wider readership - see &lt;a href="http://www.popbioethics.com/2012/02/why-mass-effect-is-the-most-important-science-fiction-universe-of-our-generation/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(many thanks to &lt;a href="http://altthoughtprocess.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;George Lockett&lt;/a&gt; for the link).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Disclaimer: it is an irrefutable law that any system of thought sufficiently advanced to be useful will contain flaws. &amp;nbsp;Transhumanism as a concept is not perfect, nor are all of its aims compatible with my personal ethical stance -

"to grok", meaning (according to Google) "To understand (something) intuitively or by empathy". &amp;nbsp;It has different nuances to different cultural groups, but it's heavily used by computer geeks to imply a deeper understanding of a skill or technology; to merely &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;a programming language such as Perl is to be familiar with its syntax and form, whereas to &lt;i&gt;grok&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;it is to be able to transcribe your thoughts into Perl with no noticable effort, to think in a "Perl-y" way rather than to think of an abstract program and then to crowbar it into working within your restrictions. &amp;nbsp;To dance with it, rather than wrestle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Anyway, I'm 39 pages into the copy I picked up in the January Sales a few days ago (apparently this is an extended edition, so your copy may vary), and found this fantastic exchange that so perfectly sums up my feelings, that I simply had to share it with the internet. &amp;nbsp;Jill is a nurse in the hospital that is treating the recently-repatriated "Man From Mars", and Ben is a newshound trying to grill her for details, and simultaneously filling her in on the significance of the Stranger:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Ben: As you know, his [the Secretary General's] administration is shaky. &lt;br /&gt;Jill: I don't pay any attention to politics.&lt;/span&gt;Ben: You should. &amp;nbsp;It's only barely less important than your own heartbeat. &lt;br /&gt;Jill: I don't pay any attention to that, either.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's not that I wish to imply that politics is unimportant - on the contrary, it is VITALLY important that there is a strong, responsible, representative, and moral assembly heading up the country, and organising those things that would not otherwise be accomplished (or be done less efficiently) through private enterprise or competition. &amp;nbsp;Any system of government that involves more than two parties competing for votes will necessarily cause, as an emergent property of the system, political&amp;nbsp;maneuvering. &amp;nbsp;These conflicts are, themselves, highly important, as it is through their success or failure that the ruling party maintains or loses its power, and thus that the edicts are issued which affect all our lives. &amp;nbsp;They are fundamentally important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's just that they're not &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This is a matter of subjectivity, of course - there are some people who gain a huge amount of satisfaction from the intricacies of celebrity gossip, and in the same way that I can understand that pleasure without sharing it, I can see that the ins-and-outs of Westminster or Washington could be just as fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more than that, it's not, to my mind, productive. &amp;nbsp;It is, of course, crucially important in theory that, in a democracy, citizens are able to engage with and influence the course of the politics that affects them, and that they remain aware of and well-informed on the issues of the day. &amp;nbsp;But (and I say this fully aware of my position as one who is hugely apathetic towards the political process) it seems to me that any private citizen, or even a group of them, cannot make any noticable impact on the minds of policy makers, without significant financial backing - it seems that politics is conducted only by politicians, and political groups. &amp;nbsp;The Fox-Hunting ban, the War in Iraq, the University Fees hike - all of these appeared to be loudly opposed by the public, and yet were still condoned by the government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be horrifyingly naive of me to confuse being vocal with being in the majority, or to refuse to acknowledge that the smooth and efficient running of politics necessitates certain compromises of values. &amp;nbsp;Nevertheless, the impression that I've gained is that it's impossible to make any impact on decision-making without extensive connections, and considerable expense of time and effort, and so I can't see why people would stir themselves to do so on matters that don't directly influence them. &amp;nbsp;Make no mistake, I'm inordinately grateful that such worthy causes as women's rights and the abolition of slavery have been supported by worthy, selfless, champions - but I can't understand their motivation. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I'm a selfish person, but to expend such extraordinary effort, in the face of such frustrating opposition, on behalf of another's cause, takes altruism of which I can only dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, politics (in a developed, democratic, country, such as the one in which I am privileged to live) is very much like my heartbeat. &amp;nbsp;It functions, better or worse, and it does so despite my lack of attention - in fact, it would be nearly unaffected by any effort of mine to affect it. &amp;nbsp;I am very glad of what it does, but I see no gains to be made in examining it too closely.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7950918727889811378-5215367510049087217?l=nftnf.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://nftnf.blogspot.com/2011/12/henleinian-interlude.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Scubbo)</author><thr:total>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7950918727889811378.post-6691065425624261132</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2011 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-12-28T02:00:40.737Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Skyrim Diary</category><title>Skyrim Diary 1 - Background and Character Creation</title><description>For those not familiar with RPGs, usually you are given the opportunity (either before the game starts, or very early in proceedings) to create your character. &amp;nbsp;Depending on the game, this can be anything from giving them a name, to picking their main skills, to microadjusting every stat, ability, and aspect of their appearance. &amp;nbsp;The Elder Scrolls tend to the latter extreme (though offering some pre-built examples if you don't fancy hours of customization!). &amp;nbsp;Many players of relatively open-ended games also make some sort of decision as to the style of personality they want their character to have, and will then bear this out through their in-game actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other RPGs, I've always played a goodie-two-shoes character, who gives to beggars, tries to make everyone happy, and to resolve every petty grievance or mild dispute, no matter how minor. When I did make a conscious decision to play less of a Paladin-like character, they ended up being even more one-dimensional; their "evil" simply being expressed by talking tough, making threats, and demanding more money for every job. In my defence, a lot of this was due not to my poor RP-ing skills, but to the design of the games themselves; it's pretty hard to RP a genuinely nuanced character when you simply *have* to complete do-gooder quests to complete the storyline, with your only "choice" being how you phrase your acceptance ("of course, I'd love to help"/"hmph, there's better be something in it for me!"). &amp;nbsp;It's very hard to convincingly roleplay a homicidal maniac or surly loner, since that will rapidly deprive you of quest opportunities! &amp;nbsp;Of course, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; some games that offer genuine moral choices beyond "Pet/Kick the Dog", but for the most part, you're railroaded into being a hero, anti- or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/sewPY0" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="188" src="http://bit.ly/sewPY0" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;I swear, I googled "Anti-hero" and that's what came up...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around, presented with the latest offering from Bethesda, the kings of open-ended gameplay, I decided I actually wanted to put the RP into RPG and give my character some individuality.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to really engage with playing the game; not just as a challenge to be overcome, but as a story, and a world, in which to be vicariously immersed. To that end, I decided to make a character very different from myself; the more similar they are to me, the less experience I get of considering how the events depicted would actually affect a real person experiencing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Anyone reading my description of the pathetically eager-to-please do-gooder probably recognised more&amp;nbsp; than a little of me in it (with varying degrees of contempt), so my first two decisions in character design were made specifically to distinguish the character from myself; to make them of a different moral outlook than myself, and to make her female. This will probably be the point at which armchair psychologists start to sit up and pay attention. Do tell me what disorders or complexes I'm suffering from as soon as you find out, I'd love to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;From the little I'd played of Skyrim previous to getting a legal copy, I knew that race was a pretty major issue. &amp;nbsp;A little potted history for those who aren't Elder Scrolls nerds (and trust me, there are pages and pages of fictional history if that's your thing) - at the end of the last game, 200 years previously, the Empire was left leaderless after the Emperor sacrificed himself to save the realm, and in the intervening time various outlying regions have been growing restless or outright seceding. &amp;nbsp;Chief among these is Skyrim, to the north of the main landmass, inhabited by a proud people called the Nords. &amp;nbsp;As the first settling-place of humanity, and the homeland of Talos, the only human to ascend to godhood, the Nordic region houses people very proud of their heritage and history, and suspicious of any attempts to restraint their liberty. &amp;nbsp;When an invading force from the Aldmeri Dominion (a collection of Elvish countries) demanded that the defeated Empire signed the White-Gold Concordat (which, among other conditions of surrender, outlawed the worship of Talos), many Nords were outraged. &amp;nbsp;Racial tensions are rife, civil war is brewing, and heads will roll...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, race will be a key factor. &amp;nbsp;I knew from the small amount I'd already played that the player would have the opportunity to join the separatist movement (the Stormcloaks), and presumably there would also be the chance to assist the Imperial Legion in subduing the colonies. &amp;nbsp;Since I'm going for a radically different character to myself, I decided to make my character (who by this point I'd named Alyssa) excessively racist - having suspicion and distrust of non-Nordic people, and massive distaste for non-human races.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a little background and motivation for this trait, I decided that, somewhere in her backstory, there'd been some massive trauma related to the Aldmeri Dominion - maybe a patrol had torched her village, or killed her family, or something similar. &amp;nbsp;Yep, it's clichéd, but I'm not exactly an author! &amp;nbsp;This immediately led on to another character trait that could provide excellent RP - self-sufficiency and defensiveness. &amp;nbsp;Leading on from her suspicious nature, I decided that Alyssa would be wary of being perceived as weak or vulnerable, but fiercely loyal to those who have shown their worth. &amp;nbsp;This has informed some excellent examples of characterisation in my early play - at one point, I actually turned down a minor quest to recover some loot from a wronged merchant, because I'd already allied myself with the Thieves' Guild who had cheated him. &amp;nbsp;There would have been no repercussions of my taking the quest line - but, despite losing the opportunity for a bit of easy gold, I felt much more satisfied in knowing that I was playing a character, rather than simply grinding through quests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This character choice also made an obvious choice of class. &amp;nbsp;Alyssa struck me as someone who would want to be in control of the situation at all times, and to always have the upper hand on everyone - what better class than a rogue, who can sneak in the shadows, pick up on choice titbits of information, and, when the time comes, strike from a powerful position and then retreat into the night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, it's getting late, and I've probably already given armchair psychiatrists far more than they can handle all in one go. &amp;nbsp;Next post will deal with my early game, and any interesting experiences in the game, as well as a bit of a review of the game itself (spoiler alert: I really like it).&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7950918727889811378-6691065425624261132?l=nftnf.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://nftnf.blogspot.com/2011/12/skyrim-diary-1-background-and-character.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Scubbo)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7950918727889811378.post-6310379737654790896</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2011 19:38:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-12-27T19:38:08.939Z</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>Skyrim Diary</category><title>Skyrim.  Oh my.</title><description>As hard as it is for me to believe, there will be some people with access to the internet who &lt;i&gt;haven't&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;heard of Skyrim, the fifth Elder Scrolls game. &amp;nbsp;Allow me to introduce it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Elder Scrolls series, by Bethesda Game Studios, is widely regarded as having led the way in&amp;nbsp;the RPG genre in terms of scope and freedom. &amp;nbsp;A hallmark of the series has been the liberty to play the game in many different styles, and with a great deal of role-playing - though the games have extensive (and impressively designed) "main" mission arcs, it is entirely possible to spend many hundreds of hours exploring the world (the second game, Daggerfall, is reputed to have a play area twice the size of Great Britain), carrying out side missions, roaming the wilderness, clearing out dungeons, and rising to prominence in various guilds and organisations. &amp;nbsp;Hell, there's literally days' worth of gameplay potential in hunting and skinning animals, and mining and refining ores, to craft your own weaponry and armor; in gathering alchemical ingredients and finding their effects to brew powerful potions and poisons; in learning the secrets of enchantments, and gathering the means necessary to forge your own magical artifacts. &amp;nbsp;You can catch about fifteen different diseases and disorders, including vampirism and lycanthropy ("werefolfism"). &amp;nbsp;You can carry out quests for several of the native gods and demons who are hanging around the continent of Tamriel. &amp;nbsp;And that's without getting into the backstory - almost every building you can enter will have a bookshelf or two, with readable books, often detailing the politics, history, and culture of the regions you're inhabiting. &amp;nbsp;The list of &lt;i&gt;titles&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;of books in Skyrim alone runs to 2 1/2 pages on my browser (http://bit.ly/twkKtf) - and this is literature that the dev team are fully aware you may not ever even bother with, because you're too busy casting spells, swinging swords, and killing bad guys. These are DEEP games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I greatly enjoyed both Morrowind and Oblivion (the third and fourth installments in the series), and have been waiting with bated breath for the latest game, Skyrim, since I saw this trailer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://3.gvt0.com/vi/PjqsYzBrP-M/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PjqsYzBrP-M&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PjqsYzBrP-M&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;DRAGONS!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, I wanted to play Skyrim on the PC, as another characteristic of the series is its extensive modding community, but I didn't know whether it would run ok on my aging laptop. Oblivion, the previous game, had run fairly smoothly, but I imagined there would be a big step up. &amp;nbsp;After running a pirated version of the game on my laptop for a few days, it became clear that that wasn't a feasible option, so I decided, sadly, to forego the amazing modding possibilities for a smooth-running game on the XBox 360, and bought a copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was about two weeks ago, and I can safely say that this is one of the most immersive and impressive game experiences I've ever enjoyed. &amp;nbsp;That's not to say that it's perfect, because it's not. &amp;nbsp;Several bugs are definitely present - companion AI leaves something to be desired, some conversation trees don't make complete sense, and horses sometimes seem to have trouble deciding where ground-level is - but when you set out to make a game as open-ended and ambitious as this, some flaws are inevitable. &amp;nbsp;The only way to make a flawless game (or, indeed, any work of art) is to play it safe, to take no risks, and to stay well within your comfort zone. &amp;nbsp;I'd rather enjoy something that occasionally stumbles as it pushes the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days into play, I decided that a play diary could be an interesting thing to do. &amp;nbsp;If this gets overwhelmingly negative responses, I'll stop (lord knows there's enough people on the internet talking about Skyrim already!), but it could be fun! &amp;nbsp;For any ardent gaming-haters out there (why are you reading my blog again!?), please do at least read installment on character creation, as it strays into some interesting psychological territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and one more thing - I can confidently predict that one of the first comments on this post will be George railing against the fact that I still haven't played Arkham City yet. &amp;nbsp;Sorry George.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1'
