Players only love you when they're playing!!!
Why does it always rain on me!?
Let's begin at the beginning: We're lovers and we're losers, we're heroes and we're pioneers, we're beggars and we're choosers.
I am heaven sent, don't you dare forget.  I am all you've ever wanted, what all the other boys all promised.
Shot through the heart, and you're too blame!  Darling, you give love a bad name!
I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright!
And I was like baby, baby, baby, oh! Baby, baby, baby, no!
And I can't fight this feeling anymore; I've forgotten what I started fighting for!
Can I play with madness!?
Are you gonna be my girl?
When I was a young boy, my father took me into the city, to see a marching band.
It may not feel too classy begging just to eat. But you know who does that? Lassie. And she always gets a treat.
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone, I'm out of my head, can't take it!!
Coming out of my cage, and I've been doing just fine; gotta gotta be down, because I want it all!!
Your hand's upon a loaded gun and you're looking down the sight.
One night to be confused, one night to speed up truth; we had a promise made, four hands and then away.
Standin' on the rooftops, everybody scream your heart out!
I told the witch doctor I was in love with you!!
I'm a Barbie girl, in my Barbie world!! Life in plastic, it's fantastic!!
Skyrockets in flight, afternoon delight!!
And I need you now tonight, and I need you more than ever!  And if you'd only hold me tight, we'd be holding on forever!!
We built this city on rock and roll!!
And I've no more blood to bleed, 'cos my heart has been draining into the sea!
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind; the answer is blowing in the wind.
All the lonely people, where do they all come from!? All the lonely people, where do they all belong!?
Sweet home Alabama, where the skies are so blue! Sweet home Alabama, Lord I'm coming home to you!!
I want to get away, I want to fly away!!
Don't you forget about me!!
I'm doing science and I'm still alive!
(doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo) Barbara Streisland!!
Wishing well, will you marry me? And are you wearing the suffering?
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of beer...
Hotel, motel, holiday Inn!
I don't care if Monday's blue, Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too!
Cos you got my heart in a headlock, you stopped the blood and made my head soft, and god knows, you got me sewn.
Girl, I want to be with you, all day and all of the night!
I'll be your number one with a bullet; a loaded God complex, cock it and pull it!
El perro, el perro, es mi corazon! El gato, el gato, el gato no es bueno!
I'll be your long-haired lover from Liverpool, and I'll do anything you ask!
Layla, you've got me on my knees! Layla, I'm begging, darling, please!
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby!
I can't get no satisfaction!!
You can't always get what you want; but if you try, sometimes, you'll find, you get what you need!
When I get lonely, and the longing gets too much; she sends acomfort coming in from above!
There's a lady who's sure, all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven...
It's just your nineteenth nervous breakdown!
Lipgloss lies, doing the time, never gonna miss what I left behind!
We don't need no education!
Take me out, into the black; tell the word I ain't coming back! Burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me!
Take me out, into the black; tell the word I ain't coming back! Burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me!
Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to me?
Hello, is it me you're looking for?
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter, to me!
I wanna live like common people!
Please, please, please; let me, let me, let me, get what I want!
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball!
Soy un perdedor; I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
Like the angel you are, you laugh creating a lightness in my chest!
All this feels strange and untrue, and I won't waste a minute without you.
There must be some kind of way out of here, said the Joker to the Thief!
My mind is tellin' me no, but my body, my body's tellin' me yes!
They're gonna clean up your looks, with all the lies in their books, to make a citizen out of you!
I am not your rolling wheels, I am the highway!
There is love burning to find you, will you wait for me? Will you  be here?
Take this life, I'm right here, stay a while and breathe me in!
If you leave me now, you'd take away the biggest part of me!
But I will hold on hope, and I won't let you choke, on the noose around your neck!
Forever's gonna start tonight!
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus!
I want to break free, I want to break free!
You took the words right out of my mouth; it must have been while you were kissing me!
Miss black eyeliner, you'd look finer, with each day in hiding...
Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, anointed Solomon king!
There she stood, in the street, smiling from her head to her feet!
Find me and follow me, through corridors, refectories and files!
Ramona, Ramona!
Is this burning an eternal flame?
In my place, in my place, were lines that I couldn't trace!
I wanna know what love is! I want you to show me!
I've got another confession to make; I'm your fool!
Teach me how to understand Christmas!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl!
Whooooo, are you!?
All you touch, and all you see, is all your life will ever be...
Is there anybody out there?
This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow - the pirate so brave, on the seven seas!
Push it to the limit!
I wanna know what love is! I want you to show me!
Now I will tell you what I've done for you; fifteen thousand tears I've cried!
Heaven is a halfpipe!
Say my name, say my name!
What's my age again?
Fix up, look sharp!
Got so many clothes, I keep some at my aunt's house!
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor!
It's looking like a beautiful day!
Throw those curtains wide; one day like this a year would see me rise!
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts; but you've got to walk away now.
This is the greatest and best song in the world; Tribute.
These girls fall like dominoes!
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you son; I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one!
She was more like a beauty queen, from a movie scene!
Tommy used to work on the dock!
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips!
Go shorty, it's your birthday!
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips!
Go shorty, it's your birthday!
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands; and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands.
The only thing I'll ever ask of you, you've got to promise not to stop when I say when!
I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier!
I wish I was special - you're so fucking special!
The drugs don't work, they just make things worse!
Happiness, hit her like a train on a track!
No-one's gonna take me alive! The time has come to make things right!
They won't see us waving from such great heights!
At the car wash!
Come with me, willingly, and do such awful things; I think you'd find that a little bit exciting!
I wanna do bad things to you...
Scream if you wanna go faster
Hearts on fire, strong desire, burning deep within!
It's the final countdown!
I just can't get you outta my head!
Oops, I did it again!
And she's buying a stairway to heaven!
Let's get fucked up and die!
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play!
Don't worry, be happy!
You don't know how you met me, you don't know why you can't turn around and say goodbye!
And it's written clear in my diary, today should have been ouranniversary...
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me!
I'm on my way, from misery to happiness today!
I would walk 500 miles, and I would walk 500 more=85
I said a bang, bang, a-bangiddy-bang, I said a bang-bang bangiddy-bang!
I need a few thins from the grocery, do things alone now most-er-ly...
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby!
Hold tight, Sir Pimpleton!
Out to Ryan, out to Chuddy.
I can't help thinking, we could have had it all!
Step to the bass, and the lyrical swagger!
Do you love me, now that I can dance?
You were always on my mind!
No alarms and no surprises!
Well sometimes, I go out by myself, and I look across the water!
All the young dudes, carry the news!
Without love, where would you be now?
There's a rat in me kitchen, what am me gonna do?
I wanna rock!
And I cherish you, my love!
You! I want to take you to a gay bar!
Hate to say I told you so!
I'm happy, feeling glad; I've got sunshine in a bag!
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace!
Nothing lasts forever, in the cold november rain!
Where do we go from here?
I touch the fire and it freezes me=85
Du, du hast, du hast mich!
Rah rah Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen!
I walk a lonely road, the only road that I have ever known!
Nothing lasts forever, in the cold november rain!
Where do we go from here?
I touch the fire and it freezes me=85
Du, du hast, du hast mich!
God gave rock and roll to you!
Block-rockin' beats!
Sittin' on the dock of the bay!
"Reach out and touch faith!"
Love is the answer, at least to most of the questions in my heart
God loves his children!
I'm the hip-hop-apotamus, my rhyme's are bottomless...
Change your heart=85look around you=85
Be my baby, one more time!
Do you really want to hurt me? Do you really want to make me cry?
