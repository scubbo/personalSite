		<h1>Maths is beautiful</h1>
		<p>Really, really, beautiful</p>
		<p>Not only the results that it generates, but so too are the methods and thought processes used in the endeavour of creative mathematics</p>
		<p>For a more eloquent description of the mind of a mathematician, try <a href="http://www.quora.com/Mathematics/What-is-it-like-to-understand-advanced-mathematics">this</a> link on Quora</p>
		<p>One of the most famously beautiful results in mathematics is Euler's Identity. This can be expressed as </p>
		<p> \[ e^{i&pi;} + 1 = 0 \]</p>
		<p>This page is an attempt to explain both the beauty of the result, and the beauty of its derivation.</p>
		<p>Throughout the derivation, there will be opportunities to learn more, or to get a justification for a certain statement. These addenda will be marked by clickable links reading <a class="moreLink" x-target="introSection"></a></p>

			<p>Yep, just like that! Note that you can click the link above to collapse this box - or, for longer boxes, click the link at the bottom.</p>

		<p>The intention of this is to demonstrate that all mathematical discoveries build on lower-level results or discoveries. In this way, we can use a short sentence to express a very complicated concept, because each word or phrase can be "unpacked" to give more meaning. Thus, with no "drilling down", the proof of the identity is simply as follows:</p>
		<p>Note to self - definitions of e, cos, and sin here :) </p>
		<p>\[ e^{ix} = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{&infin;} \frac{x^n}{n!} \] <a class="moreLink" x-target="taylorSeries"></a></p>
		<div id="taylorSeries" class="moreSection">
			<h3>Huh? Where did that come from?</h3>
			<p>This is called a "Taylor Series"</p>
		</div>
		<p>\[ e^{ix} = cos(x) + i sin(x) \] </p>
		<p>\[ \implies e^{i&pi;} = cos(&pi;) + i sin(&pi;) = -1 + 0 = -1 \]</p>
		<p>\[ \implies e^{i&pi;} + 1 = 0 \]</p>
		<p>Work in progress (Hi Toni!)</p>
